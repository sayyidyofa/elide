/**
 * Describes the expected API surface for a resolver of server-side assets, which, in cooperation with an [AssetReader]
 * and under the management of an [AssetManager], is responsible for checking asset paths for existence and translating
 * them to absolute paths which may be read and served.
 *
 * ### Asset tags
 * &quot;Asset tags&quot; are short strings which are computed at build time from a cryptographic hash of the asset's contents.
 * Tags can be used to serve an asset from the asset controller, using URLs like `/_/asset/{tag}.{ext}`, where `{tag}`
 * is the asset tag and `{ext}` is the asset's file extension (prefix adjustable by user).
 *
 * Developers reference assets by their *module ID*, which is a short recognizable string assigned by the developer to a
 * given asset.
 *
 * @see AssetReader which is charged with efficiently reading asset content.
 * @see AssetManager which coordinates between the [AssetReader] and [AssetResolver].
 * @see RenderedAsset for the generic return value model leveraged by [AssetManager].
 * @see ServerAsset for the symbolic asset reference model leveraged by [AssetManager].
