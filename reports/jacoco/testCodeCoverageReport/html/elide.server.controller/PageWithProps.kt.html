/**
 * Extends [PageController] with support for page-level [State], produced via the [props] method; computed state is
 * shared with VM render executions, and can additionally be injected into the page for use by frontend code (typically
 * to hydrate a server-rendered UI).
 *
 * ### Defining custom page state
 *
 * When extending `PageWithProps`, a [State] class must be provided which follows a set of requirements. All [State]
 * classes must:
 *
 * - Be annotated with [kotlinx.serialization.Serializable] to facilitate DOM injection of prop structure. Annotating
 *   a class with `Serializable` has its own set of requirements; see the Kotlin Serialization Guide for more info.
 * - Annotated with [HostAccess.Export] for each SSR-available property -- this can occur at the top level of a tree
 *   of properties, for instance
 *
 * An example of compliant custom page [State]:
 * ```kotlin
 * @Serializable
 * data class HelloProps(
 *   @get:HostAccess.Export val message: String = &quot;Hello World!&quot;,
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * And providing that state via the [PageWithProps] controller:
 * ```
 * @Page class HelloPage : PageWithProps&lt;HelloProps&gt;(HelloProps.serializer()) {
 *   override suspend fun props(): HelloProps {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using state from SSR executions
 *
 * When running guest language code for SSR, for instance JavaScript, [State] is made available and can be loaded using
 * frontend tools -- for instance, [elide.js.ssr.boot]:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * boot&lt;HelloProps&gt; { props -&gt;
 *   // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Optionally, the developer can load the inlined server-side props on their own, via a known DOM ID:
 *
 * ```js
 * JSON.parse(document.getElementById(&quot;ssr-data&quot;).textContent || '{}')
 * ```
 *
 * In SSR mode, [elide.js.ssr.boot] will read the props (if any), and provide them to the entrypoint for the application
 * so initial render or hydration may be performed, based on the active serving mode.
 *
 * @param State Represents the serializable property state associated with this controller. [propsAsync] is executed to
 *   produce the rendered set of page props. If no state is needed, use [Any].
 * @param serializer Kotlin serializer to use for the state attached to this controller.
 * @param defaultState Default state value to inject, if any.
