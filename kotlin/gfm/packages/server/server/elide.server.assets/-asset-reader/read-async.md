# readAsync

[jvm]\
abstract suspend fun [readAsync](read-async.md)(descriptor: [ServerAsset](../-server-asset/index.md), request: HttpRequest&lt;*&gt;): Deferred&lt;[RenderedAsset](../-rendered-asset/index.md)&gt;

Given a resolved asset [descriptor](read-async.md) which should be known to exist, read the associated asset content, and return it as an async Deferred task which can be awaited, and then consumed.

#### Return

Deferred task which resolves to a rendered asset which may be consumed, corresponding to [descriptor](read-async.md).
