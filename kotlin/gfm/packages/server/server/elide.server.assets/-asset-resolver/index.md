# AssetResolver

@[API](../../../../../packages/base/base/elide.annotations/-a-p-i/index.md)

interface [AssetResolver](index.md)

Describes the expected API surface for a resolver of server-side assets, which, in cooperation with an [AssetReader](../-asset-reader/index.md) and under the management of an [AssetManager](../-asset-manager/index.md), is responsible for checking asset paths for existence and translating them to absolute paths which may be read and served.

###  Asset tags

&quot;Asset tags&quot; are short strings which are computed at build time from a cryptographic hash of the asset's contents. Tags can be used to serve an asset from the asset controller, using URLs like `/_/asset/{tag}.{ext}`, where `{tag}` is the asset tag and `{ext}` is the asset's file extension (prefix adjustable by user).

Developers reference assets by their *module ID*, which is a short recognizable string assigned by the developer to a given asset.
