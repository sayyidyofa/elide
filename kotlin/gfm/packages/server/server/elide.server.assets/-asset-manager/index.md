interface [AssetManager](index.md)

Describes the API surface of an *Asset Manager*, which controls access to embedded server-side assets such as CSS and JS documents.

The asset manager is responsible for maintaining a runtime registry of all available assets, which is typically built at server startup. Assets should be held in memory so they may easily be resolved, dynamically transformed, and ultimately served to end-users through either user-defined controllers or the built-in asset controller.

###  Asset descriptors

During the app build, the Elide build tools package scripts for use with SSR or client-side serving. After packaging assets from internal and external builds, protocol buffer descriptors are computed and embedded in the application, which describe how each asset should be served, addressed, and treated with regard to dependencies.

At server startup, the encoded descriptors are loaded, assets are interpreted and loaded, and the server refers to the resulting mapping when called upon to serve assets.

###  Offloading

Static assets do exist on disk, technically, but when embedded in an application JAR or native image, they are automatically zipped and inlined into the application binary. Therefore, OS-level tools like `sendfile` aren't an option.

However, Micronaut and KotlinX Coroutines both have built-in IO scheduling support, which is usually backed by a pool of cached POSIX threads. This offers a good alternative for offloading I/O from a user-defined request handler.

###  Customizing the asset system

The [AssetManager](index.md) is a simple interface which mediates between an [AssetResolver](../-asset-resolver/index.md) and [AssetReader](../-asset-reader/index.md) implementation pair to serve assets at mapped HTTP paths. In some cases, the developer may want to customize this behavior, either in the way asset paths are translated or interpreted (via a custom [AssetResolver](../-asset-resolver/index.md)), or the way asset content is loaded and returned (via a custom [AssetReader](../-asset-reader/index.md)). Both can be used at once if needed.

To customize a given asset system component, use the `Replaces` annotation from Micronaut's context module. For example:

```kotlin
package your.package.here;

import elide.server.assets.AssetReader;
import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Replaces;

@Replaces(ServerAssetReader::class)
public class MyCoolAssetReader: AssetReader {
  // (impl here)
}
```

The [AssetManager](index.md) participates in the DI container, so the developer only needs to provide a component definition. Later, when an [AssetManager](index.md) instance is requested by the app, the main implementation will load and use the developer's custom implementation.
