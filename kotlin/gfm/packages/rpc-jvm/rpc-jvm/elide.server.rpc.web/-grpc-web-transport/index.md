# GrpcWebTransport

[jvm]\
interface [GrpcWebTransport](index.md)

Describes the provided API surface for a manager which holds a connection to a backing gRPC server, which is used to fulfill requests on behalf of Elide's gRPC Web integration.

This manager is typically used by the [GrpcWebService](../../../../../packages/rpc-jvm/elide.server.rpc.web/-grpc-web-service/index.md) to maintain an open connection (or connection pool) to the fulfilling server. During testing, this interface may be overridden to mock the backing server without needing network access.
